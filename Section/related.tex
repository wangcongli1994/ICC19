\section{Related Work}

Previous studies have shown the need for analyzing browser security warnings of HTTPS errors.

%这一段讲Invalid Certificates.
Researchers take large scale scans of HTTPS certificate ecosystem including IPv4 space, certificate transparency logs, and Alexa Top 1 Million websites
    to provide data sets of known certificates \cite{Durumeric2014Analysis} \cite{Durumeric2013ZMap} \cite{Holz2011The} \cite{Vandersloot2016Towards}.
    Using collections of certificates,
    researchers build certificate linters to measure certificate compliance with
    community standards such as CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, RFC 5280, and RFC6277 \cite{x509lint} \cite{certlint} \cite{kumar2018tracking}.
    As a result, they find a large proportion of invalid certificate in the wild.%例如证书撤销，证书过期，弱算法
    More than that, there are even many invalid certificates signed by browser-trusted CAs.

%这一段讲FrankenCerts
Other than large scale scans of HTTPS ecosystem,
    some researchers focus on measuring the quality of certificate validation in SSL/TLS implementations.
    Frankencert \cite{brubaker2014using} and Symcerts \cite{chau2017symcerts} are both designed to check whether SSL/TLS clients correctly validate X.509 certificates.
    RFCcert tests bugs in certificate validation of SSL/TLS implements by extracting rules directly from RFCs \cite{chen2018rfc}.

%这一段讲 HPKP  HSTS
A number of HTTPS security polices have been developed to enhance HTTPS security.
    As a result, many studies focus on the development of HTTPS security polices.
    Clark et al. \cite{Clark2013SoK} provide a theoretical evaluation of HTTPS policies for improve the HTTPS security.
    Amann et al. \cite{Amann2017Mission} analyze the deployment of HSTS and HPKP by active scans and passive monitoring.
    Pokeinthe \cite{pokeinthe2017HSTS} ran a scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million websites in Q2 2017. The results shows a more than 40 percent increase in the use of HSTS preloded and HPKP.
    Santos et al. \cite{Santos2016Implementation} measure the implementation state of HSTS and HPKP in both browsers and servers.
    Across these early studies, we find that, although HSTS and HPKP are growing in adoption, the deployment is disappointing,
    misconfigurations may higher your risk.

%这一段讲错误分类、浏览器警告级别
In 2013, Akhawe's study divided browser warnings into HTTPS warnings and phishing scam warnings,
    and studied the probability of users ignoring warnings and risking to continue browsing \cite{Akhawe2013Alice}.
    The 2017 study by Acer et al. further subdivided browser error warnings into server-side errors, client-side errors, and network errors,
    and counted the number of errors \cite{Acer2017Where}.
    Bernhard Amann's research proposes three categories: certificate chain construction error, certificate chain verification error and domain name verification error, and gives suggestions for reducing the probability of error \cite{Akhawe2013Here}.

None of the previous researches focused on the level of browser warnings.We built a warning level system and matched the HTTPS errors to the warning level.
