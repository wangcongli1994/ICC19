HTTPS has played a significant role in communication security by providing encryption data integrity and entity authentication. It is used hundreds of million of times every day in web browsers. Browsers report HTTPS security warnings if the certificate chain fails to validate. However, There is no clear industry consensus for browsers¡¯ security strategies, and four major browsers exhibiting different warning design. To get a good understanding of the browser warnings, we design a wide variety of HTTPS certificate errors and investigate the browser warning behaviors in the field. We empirically assess whether browser security warnings are as effective as suggested by popular opinion. Our results suggest that browsers may treat the same certificate error differently. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researches to ensure the security of HTTPS certificate ecosystem.
