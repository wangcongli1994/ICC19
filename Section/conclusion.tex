\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a comprehensive list of HTTPS errors,
 and investigates the security warnings of four mainstream browsers on these errors.
Several  serious defects are found in the investigation,
 and these defects may result in the problems of security in HTTPS:
a forged or revoked certificate will (probably) be accepted by users,
    or the security-enhancement of HSTS and HPKP will be ineffective.
We also present specific suggestions to improve the browsers' design of warnings.
