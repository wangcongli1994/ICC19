\subsection{HTTPS Errors}
%    In this subsection,
%    we focus on various types of errors that may trigger browser security warnings.
We list
the errors of certificate verification of basic fields and extensions,
 name validation, and also security-enhancement in HTTPS.
These errors are induced in
    the evaluated browsers.

\subsubsection{Certificate verification of basic fields}
In the TLS negotiation,
 a browser verifies the server certificate by building a valid certificate chain.

%    Chain building Error occurs
%    if the certificate chain presented by a web server
%    cannot provide enough information for a browser to build a complete chain
%    from the endpoint certificate to a trusted root certificate in the browser¡¯s root store.
\textbf{Untrusted Root CA Certificate.}
The root CA certificate of the certificate chain, sent by the visit server,
    is not trusted by browsers (i.e., not in the store of root CA certificates).
%    This error occurs when the chain of intermediate CAs linking the server certificate to a root CA untrusted by browsers.

\textbf{Untrusted Self-signed Server Certificate.}
It is a special case of untrusted root CA certificates,
    when the visited server also acts as a root CA.
        %whose subject and issuer are the same.
The server certificate is self-signed,
    and not trusted by browsers.
%    Similarly, self-signed certificate is not trusted by browsers and must be installed manually.

\textbf{Incomplete Certificate Chain.}
    Incomplete certificate chain means that
    a complete certificate chain cannot be formed due to the lack of intermediate certificates.
    %In order to build a complete certificate chain,
    %browsers obtain the intermediate certificates in three ways.
    %First, the web server presents its server certificate accompany with all the necessary intermediate certificates that can leads to a trusted root certificate.
    %Second, browsers reuse the cached intermediate certificates.
    %Third, browsers actively fetch the missing intermediate certificates through an AIA field.
    %An incomplete chain error occurs, when all the attempts fail.

\textbf{Expired Server Certificate.}
    Expired server certificate means that
    the server certificate is only valid at any time in the past
    %A certificate is only valid between its Not Before date and Not After date.
    %Expired certificate means that the Not After date is earlier than current time.
    %An expired certificate error occurs if the Not After date is earlier than current time.

\textbf{Revoked Server Certificate.}
    Revoked server certificate means that
        the CA claims that the server certificate is no longer valid before it expires by CRL, OCSP, or CRLset.

    %For security reasons,
    %CA can claim that a certificate is no longer valid before it expires by CRL, OCSP, and CRLset.
    %A revoked certificate error occurs when the server uses a revoked certificate.

\textbf{Weak Signature Algorithm.}
    Weak signature algorithm refers to the unsafe, practically breakable algorithm, such as RSA512, RSA1024 \cite{CAB2018BR}, and ECC160 \cite{NIST2005ECC}.
    %The CA/Browser Forum allows RSA and ECC keys in certificates.
    %All RSA keys should be at least 2048 bits \cite{CAB2018BR},
    %and ECC keys should be at least 256 bits \cite{NIST2005ECC}.
    %A weak signature algorithm error occurs when the key length does not meet the requirements.

\textbf{Weak Digest Algorithm.}
    Weak digest algorithm refers to the unsafe, collidable algorithm, such as SHA-1 \cite{Google2017sha1} and MD5 \cite{wang2004collisions}.
    %According to the CA/Browser Forum,
    %supported digest algorithms are SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The SHA-1 and MD5 digest algorithm have been shown to be insecure, such as two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash \cite{Google2017sha1}.

\subsubsection{Certificate Extension Validation Error}
    In addition to the basic certificate validation, we also consider the certificate extension validation: Basic Constraints, Key Usage, and Extended Key Usage.

\textbf{Basic Constraints Extension.}
    The basic constraints extension consists of a ``CA flag" and a PathLenConstraint.
    CA certificates must set the ``CA flag" as true, and server certificates must set the ``CA flag" as false.
    PathLenConstraint is a non-negative integer, and it only works for CA certificates.
    The number of intermediate certificates between current CA and the server certificate cannot greater than PathLenConstraint.

\textbf{Key Usage Extension.}
    ``no key usage" means that the certificate does not have a key usage field.
    ``server certificate: incorrect key usage" means that the server certificates don't include "Key Encipherment" in their key usage field.
    ``server certificate: correct key usage" means that the server certificates include "Key Encipherment" in their key usage field.
    ``ca certificate: incorrect key usage" means that the CA certificates don't include "Certificate Signing" in their key usage field \cite{cooper2008rfc5280}.
    %The key usage extension indicates the purpose of the public key contained in a certificate.
    %According to RFC 5280 \cite{cooper2008rfc5280},
    %all CA certificates must include "Certificate Signing" in their key usage extension, and
    %all server certificates must include "Key Encipherment" in their key usage extension.

\textbf{Extended Key Usage Extension.}
    ``no extended key usage" means that the certificate does not have a extended key usage field.
    ``server certificate: incorrect extended key usage" means that the server certificates don't include ``serverAuth" in their extended key usage field.
    ``server certificate: correct extended key usage" means that the server certificates include ``serverAuth" in their extended key usage field \cite{cooper2008rfc5280}.
    %Extended key usage extension further refines key usage extension.
    %If the extension is critical,
    %all server certificates must include "serverAuth" in their extended key usage extension.


\subsubsection{Name Validation Error}
    %Certificates are only valid for specific domain names.
    Name validation error means that domain names listed in a server certificate don't match the domain we visited.

\textbf{Domain Name Complete Mismatch.}
    Domain Name Complete Mismatch means that, there may be a complete mismatch between the domain name visited and the certificate received.
    For example, a user tries to visit www.baidu.com but gets a certificates for scholar.google.com (both CN and SAN are scholar.google.com).

\textbf{WWW Mismatch.}
    A www mismatch occurs when a user visiting www.example.com gets a certificates for example.com (both CN and SAN are example.com).

\textbf{Out-of-wildcard-scope Subdomain.}
    A out-of-wildcard-scope subdomain occurs when a user visiting a.b.example.com gets a certificates for *.example.com (both CN and SAN are *.example.com).

\textbf{Common Name or Subject Alternative Name Mismatch.}
    %Common Name (CN) and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields indicate the certificate subject identity information, and they are usually domain names.
    There are many kinds of errors with respect to CN and SAN, for example, CN does not match the domain name visited, SAN does not match the domain name visited, and the lack of CN/SAN.

\subsubsection{HTTPS Security-Enhancement Error}
%\subsubsection{Certificate verification enhancement errors}
    In recent years, some security-enhancement policies have been added to HTTPS. We will focus on HSTS and HPKP errors.

\textbf{HPKP.}
%    HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) \cite{Evans2015rfc7469} is used by web sites to instruct browsers to remember ("pin") the sites' public key over a period of time.
    A HPKP \cite{Evans2015rfc7469} error occurs when
    any public key of the certificate chain provided by the website
    does not match the pinned public keys.

\textbf{HSTS.}
    HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) \cite{hodges2012rfc6797} directs browsers to interact with given sites only over HTTPS.
%    This policy is declared by web sites via the STS header field including three directives: max-age, includeSubDomains, and preload.
    An HSTS error means that a web site deploying HSTS has a certificate validation error.
