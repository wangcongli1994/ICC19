\subsection{HTTPS Errors}
    In this subsection,
    we focus on various types of errors that may trigger browser security warnings.
    For better understanding, We classify HTTPS errors into five categories from bottom up:
    chain building errors, chain validation errors, certificate verification enhancement errors, name validation errors, and server security policy errors.

\subsubsection{Basic Certificate Validation Error}
    Chain building Error occurs
    if the certificate chain presented by a web server
    cannot provide enough information for a browser to build a complete chain
    from the endpoint certificate to a trusted root certificate in the browser’s root store.

\textbf{Self-signed Certificate.}
    Self-signed certificate is a sub-category of untrusted issuer
    whose subject and issuer are the same.
    In general, well-known self-signed root certificates are stored in the browser/OS root stores.
    Self-signed endpoint certificates are not trusted by browsers and must be installed manually.
    In addition, they are generally used in intranet websits.

\textbf{Untrusted issuer.}
    This error occurs when the browser is unable to create a chain from the server certificate to a trusted certificate authority. This typically happens when the server certificate issuer is not present in the tursted root store.

\textbf{Incomplete Certificate Chain.}
    An attacker who steals a certificate authority’s private keys is able to sign fraudulent certificates,
    for the sake of security,
    root certificates are commonly stored offline and endpoint certificates are generally signed by shorter-lived intermediate certificates.
    All major browsers cache a valid intermediate certificate seen in a connection,and reuse it to validate connections in the future \cite{Akhawe2013Here}.
    In order to build a complete certificate chain,
    browsers obtain the intermediate certificates in three ways.
    First, the web server presents its endpoint certificate accompany with all the necessary intermediate certificates that can leads to a trusted root certificate.
    Second, browsers reuse the cached intermediate certificates.
    Third, browsers actively fetch the missing intermediate certificates through an AIA field.
    An incomplete chain error occurs, if all the attempts fail.

\textbf{Expired Certificates.}
    A certificate is only valid between its Not Before date and Not After date. An expired certificate error occurs if the Not After date is earlier than current time.

\textbf{Revoked Certificate.}
    For security reasons, such as private key leakage,
     using public-key algorithm that are no longer safe, and so on. CA can claim that a certificate is no longer valid before it expires by CRL, OCSP, and CRLset. A revoked certificate error occurs when the server uses a revoked certificate.


\textbf{Key Length.}
    According to the CA/Browser Forum, All RSA keys should be at least 2048 bits \cite{CAB2018BR}.
    Futhermore, NIST’s cryptographic standards claimed that ECC keys should be at least 256 bits \cite{NIST2005ECC}.

\textbf{Weak Digest Algorithm.}
    In 2005, MD5's designer Ron Rivest wrote that "md5 and sha1 are both clearly broken (in terms of collision-resistance)" \cite{Rivest2005MD5}.
    According to the CA/Browser Forum, CAs should not issue endpoint certificates utilizing the SHA-1 algorighm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017.
    In addition, MD5 should not be used with a exceptions for root certificates issued before  31 Dec 2010 \cite{CAB2018BR}.

\subsubsection{Certificate Extension Validation Error}
    At the end of chain building, the browser has found a permutation of certificates, starting from that of the website and ending at a trusted certificate in the root store. The browser then proceeds to check this chain for expiration, revocation, and name/length constraints.

\textbf{Certificate chain length error.}
    pathLenConstraint is one of the extension fields of ca. If there is this field in the extension, pathLenConstraint must be greater than or equal to 0. If there is no such field, there is no limit. A value of 0 means that there will be no more non-self-signed intermediate CA certificates in the valid certificate path. If the pathLenConstraint value of the CA is greater than 0, it indicates the possible intermediate CA certificate in the path from the endpoint certificate to the CA certificate build. Quantity. If the CA violates the length limit signing certificate, the certificate that exceeds the limit is invalid.

\textbf{Certificate chain usage error.}
    Key usage is an extension that can have multiple values to indicate the key usage for which the certificate is licensed. The usage values of CA certificates are generally Digital Signature, Certificate Signing and cRLSign. If the CA certificate does not contain a Certificate Signing usage, the certificate it signs is invalid.

\textbf{Certificate extendedKeyUsage error.}
    The length of the keyUsage field is not sufficient to represent all possible certificate usages, and extendedKeyUsage is used to define additional certificate usage, such as: serverAuth and clientAuth.

\subsubsection{Name Validation Error}
    A name validation error occurs when a name is not found in the certificate matching the domain that the user connected to.  Figure 2 illustrates our classification algorithm that further breaks down a name validation error into the subcategories we explain below. We focus on possible changes in the browser name validation logic that could ameliorate these errors.

\textbf{Certificate has no partial fields.}
    A certificate may not have a Common Name or SAN field. In OpenSSL, certificates that do not fill in the above fields can also be generated and be signed.
    For the Common Name, some very old browsers may not support certificates without Common Name. The Chrome browser does not support certificates without a SAN field.

\textbf{WWW Mismatches.}
    A certificate only for exapmle.com does not work for www.example.com. In the past, browser developers turned down requests to change this behavior [29]. Our study helps empirically measure the impact of this decision. Note that we reuse the NSS name validation function, and do not write our own validation function for this category.

\textbf{Relaxed Matching.}
    Recall from Section 4.3 that an asterisk in a name can only match one level of names in the initial part of the DNS label. A more permissive function that matches asterisks to an arbitrary number of sub-domains (while still ensuring that it is the same TLD+1) could accept more certificates and reduce the number of warnings shown to users. We measured this via our own implementation of such a relaxed matching algorithm, which is available online as part of our code release [1].

\textbf{Registered Domain Match.}
    If a user connecting to sub.example.com receives a certificate for example.com, it is arguably a lower threat than an invalid certificate chain. Note that browsers already do not fully isolate sub-domains. Arguably, a name validation error in which the SNI and the presented certificate share the registered domain is lower risk than if the presented certificate is for a totally different domain. Identifying the registered domain in a given DNS label is tricky: each top-level domain (e.g., .in) has its own policy on the suffixes under which users can directly register names. For example, the registered domain for test.example.in is example.in, but it is not gov.in for example.gov.in. This is because .in allows registrations under both the .in as well as .gov.in suffixes. We use the Mozilla maintained public suffix list to identify the registered domains for a given DNS label [38].

\subsubsection{HTTPS Security-Enhancement Error}%网站连接的安全策略问题
%\subsubsection{Certificate verification enhancement errors}

\textbf{HPKP.} HPKP is a security mechanism used by HTTPS websites
    to prevent CA organizations from issuing certificates and attacking them [21].
    It provides the SHA-256 value of two public keys prepared in advance, and specifies that the client only recognizes the public keys of the two certificates or certificate chains within the effective time.
    HPKP can pin a root certificate, an intermediate CA certificate or a endpoint certificate. The RFC recommends that the website use the SHA-256 of the intermediate CA as the public key of the pin. If the SHA-256 value of the website certificate chain does not correspond to the cached SHA-256 value, an HPKP error will be raised.

    In order to prevent attacks and improve security, the server often deploys some additional security policies on the premise that the certificate is legal and the server is legal.

\textbf{HSTS}
    HSTS is a setting that forces the browser to establish a connection with the server using HTTPS [22]. When the browser receives the HSTS header set by the server, it will force the use of HTTPS when browsing the website. If the browser has a HSTS information of a domain name, it means that during the period when max-age is in effect, when the user accesses the address through HTTP or manual input via HTTP, the browser will automatically convert HTTP to HTTPS and directly initiate. HTTPS connection request; when the website has a certificate validation error (such as certificate revocation, expiration), the browser does not allow the user to ignore the warning and continue to browse the website in an unsafe manner.

    In order to resolve the issue of unencrypted initial connections in the HSTS policy, Google has created an HSTS preloaded list. This list is integrated into all major browsers. If a site in the preloaded list cancels the preload option in the response header, it will immediately lose its eligibility in the preloaded list, and the domain name will be automatically removed from the list in the future.
